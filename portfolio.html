But after talking to my partner, Timothy, we decided that it would be more interesting to create a tower defense game with a bit of a storyline to it, this is much more complicated and uses things that we technically haven't learned, throwing out python turtle and we are now using pyglet which is a much more robust tool aimed at gaming with some elements that turtle simply cannot accomplish. This includes advanced windowing, allowing for fullscreen modes, which will allow for a much better experience for the player, it also has considerably better key detection which should allow us to interact with the program outside of the terminal prompt which will make the game much more fun to play, this will also allow us to use characters that move around using wasd, which we may integrate into the game to give it an immersive feel. Additionally, the pyglet package comes with sublibraries which should make it much easier to use them without needing to search for more libraries that we need to integrate in, things like pyglet.timer and pyglet.text will make it easier to set up a scene. Lastly, we have the main issue of performance, python as a compiled language already is very slow, turtle adds upon that with the slowness which it moves at, even with the turtle.speed(0) command. Pyglet cuts out the main issue with rendering the entire scene simultaneously which greatly speeds up the entire process. The main way to cut this is creating nearly hundreds of turtles to complete each task, this may be faster, but assigning tasks for each turtle to do is very tedious and leads to long and confusing code.The Forgotten Creatures of the Appalachian Depths are fighting the B-69 research team that was doing exploration at the bottom of a new found sea, they are met with waves of fierce creatures that are attempting to destroy the ship that they are in. This leads them to take out their emergency defense mechanisms that are pre mounted on the ship, they are deployed, but are weak at their first deployment as they are rusty and untested, however, through sucking in the dunleaum in the fish they are able to magically upgrade their defense mechanisms, this can be used on all sorts of equipment including the turrets, forcefield, dunleaum generator, dunleaum vault, and fish research.
